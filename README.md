##🍴 Recipe Popularity Predictor 🍴

In the world of cooking and culinary delights, knowing which recipes will become popular can have a significant impact on website traffic and user engagement. This project aims to predict the popularity of recipes based on a dataset of 1000 recipes, including features such as calories, carbohydrates, sugar, protein, food category, and servings. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can minimize the chance of displaying unpopular recipes on a website, ultimately attracting more visitors.





## Introduction

**OpenAI Gym** is a Python package comprising various **RL (Reinforcement Learning) environments**, including:

- 🧸 **Simple “Toy” Environments**: Simpler environments to help you start.
- 🤺 **Challenging Environments**:
  - 🤖 **Simulated Robotics**: Emulating robotic tasks and challenges.
  - 🕹️ **Atari Video Games**: Train agents in environments simulating classic Atari video games.

OpenAI Gym offers different difficulty levels and complexities suitable for a range of RL tasks.

### Mountain Car Problem 🚗🏔️

#### Problem Description

- **Context**: A car between two “mountains”. The objective is to drive up the mountain on the right, but the car's engine isn't powerful enough in a single pass.
- **Challenge**: To oscillate and gain momentum.

This problem aptly suits reinforcement learning since it's a simple representation of real-world challenges.

#### Components

- **Agent**: The car 🚗.
- **Environment**: World with mountains 🏔️.
- **Action**: Move ➡️ right, ⬅️ left or 🚫.
- **State**: Car's position 📍 and velocity 🚀.
- **Reward**: -1 📉 for each step away from the flag 🏁; maximized when reached flag in minimal steps.

#### Objective

The aim is to maximize total rewards 📈 by reaching the flag 🏁 in the least steps. Read more [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/mountain_car/).
